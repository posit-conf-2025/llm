The workshop demonstrates that:\n\nCoding with LLMs unlocks possibilities beyond standard tools\nNo advanced AI background is required\nImplementing AI can be both accessible and exciting\n\nDesigned for AI newcomers and experienced developers, the session covers LLM integration, Shiny web app development, and touches on advanced topics like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool calling. Attendees will gain hands-on experience through guided exercises, providing the confidence to start their LLM journey."

Fortunately, there’s an alternative installation method that should work just as well.\nFirst, disable renv:\nrenv::deactivate()\nThen install use pak to install the necessary packages:\n# install.packages(\"pak\")\npak::local_install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)\nOr with remotes:\n# install.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’re using uv by Astral to manage our Python environment and dependencies.

    "text": "Local models with ollama\nollama is an open-source tool for running LLMs locally on your computer. Local models do not provide the same quality of responses as flagship models from AI providers like OpenAI or Anthropic, but you can run models on your own computer without having to pay for API access or sending your data to a third party.\nYou do not need to install ollama or use local models to participate in the workshop. That said, they’re a fun way to experiment with LLMs without incurring API costs.\nTo use ollama, first download and install it on your computer. Then, you can browse the list of models on the ollama website to find a model that you want to use. Here are a few that we like for local testing. For the workshop, I’d recommend installing gemma3:4b1.\n\n\n\nID\nSize\nCapabilities\n\n\n\n\ngemma3:4b\n3.3GB\nvision\n\n\nqwen3:8b\n5.2GB\ntools thinking\n\n\ngpt-oss:20b\n14GB\ntools thinking\n\n\n\nTo use a model, you first need to download it. For example, to download gemma3:4b, run the following command in your terminal:\nollama pull gemma3:4b\nThat command downloads the model to your computer. Once the model is downloaded, you can use it on your own computer without needing to be connected to the internet.\nYou can use ollama to chat with the model directly in your terminal\nollama run gemma3:4b\nor you can use ellmer or chatlas to interact with the model from R or Python.\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(ellmer)\n\nchat &lt;- chat_ollama(model = \"gemma3:4b\")\nchat$chat(\"What is the capital of France?\")\n\nThe capital of France is Paris.\nIt’s a global center for art, fashion, gastronomy, and culture. 🌍🇫🇷\n\n\n\nfrom chatlas import ChatOllama\n\nchat = ChatOllama(model=\"gemma3:4b\")\nchat.chat(\"What is the capital of France?\")\n\nThe capital of France is Paris.\nIt’s a global center for art, fashion, gastronomy, and culture. 😊\nDo you want to know anything more about Paris?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWhy use a local model?\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal models are just like the famous ChatGPT or Claude models, but they run entirely on your own computer. You can use them for all of the same tasks: conversational AI, code generation, text processing, vision and more. There are a wide range of models available at many different sizes and capabilities, so you can choose one that fits your hardware and performance needs.\nLocal models are no where near as capable as the flagship models from OpenAI or Anthropic. Still, there are a few reasons you might want to use a local model:\n\nYour conversation never leaves your computer, ensuring complete data privacy.\nNo API costs, making local models very low-cost (other than the cost of your laptop or the hardware to run the model).\nThey work offline, so you can use them without an internet connection.\n\nLocal models are a great option for prototyping, experimentation, and personal use. They’re also useful to companies that want to use LLMs but have strict data privacy requirements and need to ensure that their data never leaves their network.\nOn the other hand, because you’re running the model on your own hardware, local models are slower and less powerful than cloud-based models, especially if you’re using a laptop or desktop computer. Personally, I use local models for experiments and testing to avoid API charges and switch to cloud-based models when I’m putting an LLM-powered application into production."
