Philly cheesesteaks are one of my favorite comfort foods. I usually
don‚Äôt purchase steak often because of the cost, but was recently
surprised to find thinly sliced pre-packaged steak at my local grocery
store for a very reasonable price. So, of course, I had to give it a
try! I added saut√©ed bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms to bulk up the
sandwiches, melted provolone cheese on top, and placed it all inside a
big hoagie roll. These were so good and very filling. Five large Philly
cheesesteak sandwiches for just a little over $3 a sandwich‚Ä¶I‚Äôll take
that all day long!

Growing up, whenever we ate at the food court in the mall, my \#1
favorite place to eat was the Philly cheesesteak restaurant. I would
skip over the pizza and burgers and go straight for those cheesy, tender
steak sandwiches. So today I‚Äôm excited to recreate and put my own spin
on an American classic for a party of 5 on a budget!!üòâ

## Budget-Friendy Philly Cheesesteak Recipe

If you didn‚Äôt know, Philly Cheesesteaks are sandwiches made with thinly
sliced steak and cheese and served on a long hoagie roll. Although its
origins are sometimes debated, the Philly Cheesesteak is mostly known
for being created in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the early 1900‚Äôs.
Common variations throughout the years have included saut√©ed onions,
bell peppers, and mushrooms. Regardless of how you like to eat your
cheesesteak, this popular recipe has been well-loved by many! And if
you‚Äôre looking for a low-carb option, try our [Philly cheesesteak
stuffed
peppers](https://www.budgetbytes.com/philly-cheesesteak-stuffed-peppers/)!

## Budget-Saving Tips!

A lot of recipes use ribeye or sirloin, but both of those can be quite
pricey. It also takes a little extra time to thinly slice all of that
meat. But if you didn‚Äôt already know, you can actually find pre-packed
thinly sliced steak in the meat section of the grocery store.¬†

During testing, I tried two different types ‚Äì one that‚Äôs listed as ‚ÄúBeef
shaved steak‚Äù and another that‚Äôs listed as ‚ÄúRibeye shaved steak.‚Äù The
ribeye shaved steak was much better quality and tasted a lot better than
just the ‚Äúbeef shaved steak. The ribeye shaved steak is a little more
expensive than just the beef shaved steak, but feel free to use either
one based on your budget.

These shaved steak packages primarily come in 12-14oz. sizes, which is
only enough to make roughly 3-4 large sandwiches. This is why I add
mushrooms, peppers, and onions to this recipe to help bulk up the
servings.

### Ingredients

‚ñ¢ 8 oz. baby bella mushrooms (sliced, $2.37)

‚ñ¢ 1 green bell pepper ($0.89)

‚ñ¢ 1 yellow onion ($0.70)

‚ñ¢ 4 Tbsp butter (divided, $0.40)

‚ñ¢ 2 Tbsp cooking oil (divided, $0.08)

‚ñ¢ 12-14 oz. shaved beef steak ($6.94\*)

‚ñ¢ ¬æ tsp salt ($0.03)

‚ñ¢ ¬Ω tsp garlic powder ($0.05)

‚ñ¢ ¬Ω tsp black pepper (freshly cracked, $0.02)

‚ñ¢ 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce ($0.10)

‚ñ¢ 5 hoagie rolls ($2.96\*\*)

‚ñ¢ 6 slices provolone ($0.98\*\*\*)

### Instructions¬†

-   Start by prepping the vegetables. Slice the green bell pepper,
    onion, and mushrooms.

-   Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add 1 Tbsp of butter and 1
    Tbsp cooking oil. Once the skillet is hot add in the sliced
    mushrooms. Stir and cook for 2-3 minutes or until the mushrooms
    start to soften.

-   Next add in the sliced onions and bell pepper to the skillet. Stir
    and cook for another 3 minutes or until the veggies have softened.
    Remove all the vegetables from the skillet to a separate plate and
    set aside.

-   In the same skillet add 1 Tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp cooking oil. Add
    the shaved beef steak to the skillet and cook until browned and
    cooked through.

-   Now add the saut√©ed peppers, onions, and mushrooms back to the
    skillet with the steak, then add in the salt, garlic powder, black
    pepper, and worcestershire sauce. Stir and cook for 1-2 minute to
    allow the vegetables to heat back up.

-   Spread the provolone cheese slices on top of the beef and vegetables
    in the skillet. Turn the heat off. Allow the residual heat to melt
    the cheese.

-   While the steak is cooking or while the cheese is melting, go ahead
    and toast the hoagie rolls. Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F. Place 5 rolls
    on a baking sheet, spread the remaining 2 Tbsp of softened butter
    inside the hoagie rolls, and toast in the oven for a few minutes
    until golden brown. Make sure to keep an eye on them. Once toasted,
    remove the sheet pan from the oven and set the rolls to the side.

-   Fill each hoagie roll evenly with the steak and cheese mixture.
    Serve these sandwiches with your favorite spreads and toppings like
    mayo, shredded lettuce, tomato, or sliced jalape√±os. Enjoy!

### Notes

\*To keep things budget-friendly and to save time, I use **thinly
pre-shaved beef steak**. You can usually find it in the ground meat
section of your grocery store. I did notice and test a couple of
different types of shaved beef; please see my budget-saving tips above.

\*\***Hoagie rolls** are traditional and a perfect vessel for holding
all of that cheesesteak goodness. You can find them packaged in the
bread aisle, but if you want to splurge a little, **try getting the
fresh hoagies in the bakery section**.

\*\*\***Provolone cheese** is my favorite with cheesesteaks, but you can
substitute with **white American**, **Swiss**, or even **Cheez Whiz** if
you‚Äôre really going for that classic cheesesteak taste!

**Add the sliced onions and bell pepper:** Stir and cook for another 3
minutes or until the peppers and onions have softened. Remove all the
vegetables from the skillet to a separate plate and set aside for now.

**Brown the beef:** In the same skillet, add another 1 Tbsp butter and 1

cook until browned and cooked through.

**Combine the filling ingredients:** Now add the saut√©ed peppers,

with 3/4 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp freshly cracked black

Spread 6 slices of provolone cheese on top of the steak in the skillet.
Turn the heat off. Allow the residual heat to melt the cheese.

**Toast the rolls:** While the steak is cooking or while the cheese is
melting, go ahead and toast the hoagie rolls. Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F.
Place 5 rolls on a baking sheet, spread the remaining 2 Tbsp of softened
butter inside the hoagie rolls, and toast in the oven for a few minutes

remove the sheet pan from the oven and set aside.

**Make the sandwiches:** Now all that‚Äôs left to do is fill each hoagie
roll evenly with the steak and cheese mixture. You can also spread some
mayo on the inside of each roll if you prefer.

Serve these sandwiches with your favorite spreads and toppings like
mayo, shredded lettuce, tomato, or sliced jalape√±os. And of course, you
have to have some crispy fries or chips on the side. Yum!! Tell me, what
are your favorite Philly cheesesteak toppings?

## Recipe Tips and Variations

1.  This recipe makes 5 huge sandwiches, but you can cut each of these
    in half to make 10 servings if you‚Äôre trying to serve them at a
    tailgate party or potluck!
2.  Not a mushroom fan? No worries, I really only added them to bulk up
    the filling and stretch the servings to five. But you can totally
    leave them off and just include the saut√©ed peppers and onions. You
    may only be able to make four large sandwiches without the
    mushrooms.
3.  You can add more cheese to your sandwiches if you really want to
    make them *extra* cheesy. I used enough cheese to cover most of the
    cheesesteak in the skillet, but feel free to add 1-3 more slices
    over the top of the skillet or on each individual sandwich. You can
    also add some Cheez Whiz if you‚Äôve got it‚Ä¶a popular choice in many
    authentic Philly cheesesteak recipes!
4.  Don‚Äôt have any steak? You can absolutely swap the steak for ground
    beef if you like. It‚Äôs not technically traditional, but it‚Äôs
    certainly cheaper and still delicious!

## **Serving Suggestions**

I paired these Philly cheesesteaks with some quick [air fryer French
fries](https://www.budgetbytes.com/air-fryer-french-fries/), but you can
also serve them with our popular [oven baked steak
fries](https://www.budgetbytes.com/oven-baked-steak-fries/) or make a
quick batch of [air fryer sweet potato
fries](https://www.budgetbytes.com/air-fryer-sweet-potato-fries/).¬†

As for toppings, you can certainly keep it simple and leave it as is
with just the peppers, onions, and mushrooms. Or try adding some
shredded lettuce, tomato, [pickled
jalape√±os](https://www.budgetbytes.com/pickled-jalapenos/), or even
slow-cooked [caramelized
onions](https://www.budgetbytes.com/caramelized-onions/), which would
taste *really* good!!
