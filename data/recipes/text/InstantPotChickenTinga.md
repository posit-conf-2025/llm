## Chicken Tinga

I have to admit I love cooking
[chicken](https://www.jocooks.com/category/ingredient/poultry/) in as
many ways as I can. It’s **easy**, **versatile** and so **tasty**! If
you’ve never made tinga before, it’s a chipotle tomato sauce and the
best thing about it, is you can make it as spicy as you like. This
chicken tinga or tinga de pollo as it’s known in Mexico, is perfect for
busy weeknights because it requires just a few minutes of prep time and
then let the pressure cooker do all the work.

-   **Juicy and tender chicken**
-   **Made in the Instant Pot**
-   **Ready in just 30 minutes**
-   **Rivals any restaurant chicken tinga**

The mild heat from the chipotle peppers combines so well with the tangy
tomato flavor giving your chicken tinga one of the most inviting Mexican
tastes out there. You’ll feel like cranking up the beat with some Latino
tunes and just trying out your salsa steps in the kitchen while your
meal is getting ready in the Instant Pot. The biggest convenience about
making this dish is that it takes very little prepping time to cooking
to reaching the dinner table. And that, my friends, is what we want from
any recipe: speed and amazing taste!

![overhead shot of all ingredients needed to make chicken
tinga.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201500'%3E%3C/svg%3E)[](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?media=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jocooks.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F05%2Finstant-pot-chicken-tinga-ingredients.jpg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jocooks.com%2Frecipes%2Finstant-pot-chicken-tinga%2F&is_video=false&description=This%20Instant%20Pot%20Chicken%20Tinga%20is%20perfect%20for%20those%20busy%20weeknights!%20Tangy%20flavorful%20tender%20chicken%2C%20cooked%20to%20perfection%20in%20a%20delicious%20homemade%20Tinga%20sauce%2C%20ready%20to%20be%20added%20to%20your%20favorite%20tacos%2C%20tostadas%20or%20even%20burritos.%20Best%20of%20all%20it's%20made%20in%20your%20Instant%20Pot%20and%20ready%20in%20just%2030%20minutes!%20%23chickentinga%20%23instantpot%20%23recipe)

### For Sauce

-   **Chipotle Peppers** – Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce to bring on
    the heat. This is one of my favorite ingredients ever and I always
    call it gold because it’s like gold in any recipe. In this recipe I
    only call for 2 peppers but this will yield a very mild sauce, so if
    you like spicy food, I’d go with more peppers, 4 or 5. The more the
    better!
-   **Onion** **and garlic**– Essential flavor enhancers to any sauce.
-   **Broth** – Chicken broth or vegetable broth are both great for this
    recipe, I opt for low sodium.
-   **Tomatoes** – I used fire roasted tomatoes because I love the extra
    smokiness that they add to this sauce. However, feel free to use
    just regular diced tomatoes.
-   **Seasoning** – Salt and pepper to taste.

### For Chicken

-   **Chicken** – I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, but you can
    also substitute that with chicken breast or chicken tenders. I find
    the thighs are juicier and perfect for this kind of dish.
-   **Olive oil** – Just a bit of olive oil to saute the onion in the
    Instant Pot. You can use other oils, such as vegetable or canola
    oil.
-   **Onion** – More onion for additional flavor.

### For Tacos

-   **Tortillas** – Corn tortillas or flour tortillas. You can also make
    your own using my [tortilla
    recipe](https://www.jocooks.com/recipes/flour-tortillas/).
-   **Avocados** – Fresh, ripe avocados, smashed. You could also make
    your own
    [guacamole](https://www.jocooks.com/recipes/easy-guacamole/) and use
    that instead.
-   **Red Onion** – One small chopped red onion. You can also use
    regular onion.
-   **Cilantro** – Roughly chop your cilantro to add as garnish to your
    tacos.
-   **Cheese** – Crumbled cotija cheese or feta cheese work best for
    this.
-   **Limes** – Lime wedges to freshly squeeze over the tacos.

## How To Make Instant Pot Chicken Tinga

1.  **Make the sauce:** In a blender, add all the sauce ingredients
    together and blend until smooth.
2.  **Saute the onion:** Turn your Instant Pot to the sauté setting and
    heat the olive oil. Add the sliced onion and cook for 2 to 3 minutes
    or until the onion has softened.
3.  **Cook the chicken:** Add the chicken and sauce to the Instant Pot
    and stir everything together. Close the lid (follow the
    manufacturer’s guide for instructions on how to close the instant
    pot lid). Set valve to sealing and set the Instant Pot to the manual
    setting and the timer to **8 minutes**. Once the Instant Pot cycle
    is complete, wait until the natural release cycle is complete,
    should take about 10 minutes. Carefully unlock and remove the lid
    from the instant pot.
4.  **Shred the chicken:** Switch the Instant Pot to the saute setting
    (do not put the lid on). Transfer the chicken thighs to a bowl and
    shred with 2 forks. Add the shredded chicken back to the instant pot
    and continue cooking on Saute mode for another 5 minutes. Taste for
    seasoning and adjust with salt and pepper as needed.
5.  **Ready to serve:** Assemble tacos by topping the tortillas with
    mashed avocados, chicken tinga, red onion, cilantro, cotija cheese
    and a drizzle of lime juice.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Chicken Tinga?

Chicken **tinga** is a dish that originated in the city of Puebla,
Mexico. Chicken tinga (known as tinga de pollo in Spanish) is made with
shredded chicken in a flavorful sauce made from tomatoes, chipotle
peppers in adobo, and sliced onions. It is often served as a protein for
taco dishes.

### How can I serve this dish?

You can serve it either warm or cold with a variety of toppings such as
sliced avocados, queso fresco, salsa, sour cream, radishes, diced onions
and cilantro as tacos, burritos, tostadas or even along some
[rice](https://www.jocooks.com/recipes/cilantro-lime-rice/).

### Is the tinga sauce spicy?

The tinga sauce made with chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, tomatoes and
onions has a mild heat to it and a tangy overall flavor that pairs well
with chicken meat. If you want it spicier, feel free to add more
chipotle peppers.

### Can I make chicken tinga in the slow cooker?

Absolutely! You can simply make the sauce as instructed, saute the
chopped onion with the olive oil in a skillet, then dump everything in
the slow cooker. Cook on **LOW for 6 hours** or **HIGH for 2 to 3
hours**. Take out the chicken and shred it, then transfer it back to the
slow cooker and cook for an additional 30 minutes on LOW. Assemble tacos
as instructed in the recipe.

![chicken tinga in a bowl with some tortillas around the
bowl.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201500'%3E%3C/svg%3E)[](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?media=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jocooks.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F06%2Finstant-pot-chicken-tinga-1-13.jpg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jocooks.com%2Frecipes%2Finstant-pot-chicken-tinga%2F&is_video=false&description=This%20Instant%20Pot%20Chicken%20Tinga%20is%20perfect%20for%20those%20busy%20weeknights!%20Tangy%20flavorful%20tender%20chicken%2C%20cooked%20to%20perfection%20in%20a%20delicious%20homemade%20Tinga%20sauce%2C%20ready%20to%20be%20added%20to%20your%20favorite%20tacos%2C%20tostadas%20or%20even%20burritos.%20Best%20of%20all%20it's%20made%20in%20your%20Instant%20Pot%20and%20ready%20in%20just%2030%20minutes!%20%23chickentinga%20%23instantpot%20%23recipe)

## Tips

1.  You can use either chicken things, chicken breast or chicken
    tenders.
2.  You can expand your topping selection to a variety of veggies and
    garnishes that can include corn, tomatoes, celery, black beans and
    the list can go on. Get creative with what you want to add.
3.  Instead of just plain smashed avocados, make
    [guacamole](https://www.jocooks.com/recipes/easy-guacamole/) and use
    that for extra flavor.
4.  Use chicken tinga for taco salads, burritos, burrito bowls, nachos,
    tostadas, etc.

## Leftovers

If you have leftover Chicken Tinga you can store the meat separately in
an airtight container in the fridge for up to **5 days** and just add
your preferred toppings onto your tacos right before serving.

### Freezer

The Chicken Tinga stores great in the freezer. Make sure your meat is
cooled down to room temperature before storing it in an airtight
container or freezer bag. It will last up to **3-4 months** in your
freezer.

    tenders.
2.  You can expand your topping selection to a variety of veggies and
    garnishes that can include corn, tomatoes, celery, black beans and
    the list can go on. Get creative with what you want to add.
3.  Instead of just plain smashed avocados, make
    [guacamole](https://www.jocooks.com/recipes/easy-guacamole/) and use
    that for extra flavor.
4.  Use chicken tinga for taco salads, burritos, burrito bowls, nachos,
    tostadas, etc.
5.  If you have leftover Chicken Tinga you can store the meat separately
    in an airtight container in the fridge for up to **5 days** and just
    add your preferred toppings onto your tacos right before serving.
6.  The Chicken Tinga stores great in the freezer. Make sure your meat
    is cooled down to room temperature before storing it in an airtight
    container or freezer bag. It will last up to **3-4 months** in your
    freezer.
