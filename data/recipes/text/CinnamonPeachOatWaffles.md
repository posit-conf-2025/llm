Delicious **cinnamon peach oat waffles** that are made with old
fashioned **oats.** Soft on the inside, crunchy on the outside, and
loaded with **peaches** and **cinnamon.**

If I’d let him, my son would eat waffles for every meal of the day. I
don’t know where this obsession came from but for the last year or so,
he’s been loving waffles and every time I ask him what he wants for
breakfast, the answer is ALWAYS “waffles!” He also only eats homemade
waffles.

I thought he’d eat store-bought but nope, he is my homemade spoiled
little guy and he would only eat homemade. So I usually make a big batch
on a weekend and freeze them. It makes it easy to pop them in a toaster
in the morning.

Weekday mornings, I’m not very much awake to make him fresh waffles, at
least until I’ve had my coffee (or two). I start my day pretty slowly
(I’m so not a morning person), making sure I have my coffee while little
man has his breakfast. It takes him a while to get through his
breakfast, so I have a solid 10 minutes to sip my coffee and stare at
the TV.

I’ve gotten pretty creative with waffles and making them healthier for
him. He loves my blueberry whole wheat waffles and I try to pack them
with fruit and berries as much as possible. To make his waffles (and
pancakes) healthier, I add flax seed, oats, carrots, zucchini, peanut
butter, whole wheat flour, and oil instead of butter. (Not all at the
same time, of course.)

### Ingredients

▢ 2 eggs

▢ 1/2 cup vegetable oil

▢ 1 cup whole milk

▢ 2 tsp vanilla extract

▢ 1/2 cup brown sugar

▢ 1 cup all purpose flour

▢ 2 cups old fashioned oats

▢ 1/2 Tbsp cinnamon

▢ 1 Tbsp baking powder

▢ 1/4 cup milled flax seed

▢ 2 medium peaches

### Instructions

-   In a medium bowl, whisk eggs, milk, oil, vanilla extract and sugar
    together until smooth.

-   Whisk in flour, cinnamon, baking powder and flax seed.

-   Mix in oats.

-   Dice peaches and fold them into the waffle batter. (You can take
    skin off or keep it on, just wash the peaches first.)

-   Let the batter stand for about 10 minutes, while your waffle maker
    is heating up.

-   You will want to grease the waffle make every couple of batches.

-   I recommend cooking waffles of a slightly lower temperature so they
    can cook a little longer (probably medium-high but it will depend of
    you waffle maker).

-   Dust cooked waffles with some powder sugar and cinnamon if desired.
