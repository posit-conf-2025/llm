As soon as the weather turns cool, I grab the cozy sweaters and start
cooking all the comfort food, like this Easy Baked Ziti recipe. It’s
rich and gooey with its layers of pasta, homemade red sauce with Italian
sausage, and blend of melty cheeses. It’s total comfort in a bowl. And
the best part is that homemade Baked Ziti is not fussy at all. You don’t
have to worry about delicate sheet pasta or tedious layering. It’s all
the great flavors of lasagna in a freeform delicious casserole!

## What Is Baked Ziti?

Baked ziti is a super cozy pasta casserole made with ziti pasta (a
smooth tube-shaped pasta), red sauce, and a mix of cheeses (ricotta,
mozzarella, and Parmesan). It has many of the same ingredients as a
classic [lasagna](https://www.budgetbytes.com/easy-homemade-lasagna/),
but the structure is much more freeform, making it really fast and easy
to make.

## Ingredients

Here’s all you’ll need to make our awesome baked ziti recipe:

-   **Italian Sausage:** This recipe starts with a homemade meat sauce
    that is made with ground Italian sausage. The sausage is stuffed
    with tons of herbs and spices, which brings a lot of flavor to the
    dish. You can use hot, mild, or sweet Italian sausage.
-   **Onion:** A little onion cooked down into the red sauce gives it a
    delicious subtle sweetness.
-   **Tomato Paste and Crushed Tomatoes:** We use two types of canned
    tomatoes to give the red sauce a rich flavor and texture. The
    crushed tomatoes create the body of the sauce without being too
    chunky while concentrated tomato paste thickens the sauce and makes
    the tomato flavor extra rich.
-   **Italian seasoning:** To keep this recipe simple, we use an Italian
    seasoning blend to season the sauce rather than several individual
    herbs and spices.
-   **Ziti:** This is a smooth, tube-shaped pasta that is perfect for
    this cozy casserole. If you can’t find ziti pasta at your local
    store, I’ve shared some of my favorite substitutions below!
-   **Cheese:** This hearty pasta casserole contains a blend of several
    cheeses: ricotta, mozzarella, and a shredded Italian cheese blend.
-   **Parsley (optional):** For extra color, you can top baked ziti with
    chopped parsley. If you happen to grow basil, you can garnish with
    chopped basil for extra color and flavor.

## Ziti Pasta Substitutions

I usually find ziti down the pasta aisle, but if you can’t find it at
your local store, try these substitutions:

-   **Rigatoni:** Rigatoni has a similar shape to ziti but has a ridged
    texture on the outside.
-   **Penne:** Penne is a tubular-shaped pasta with angled ends and will
    work just fine in a pinch!
-   **Mostaccioli:** Mostaccioli looks almost identical to penne and is
    a good substitute if it’s what you have to hand. Although, if that’s
    the case, I recommend you try our [baked mostaccioli
    recipe](https://www.budgetbytes.com/baked-mostaccioli/) instead!

But really, any pasta shape will work in this recipe. I boil the pasta
until tender (or al dente) according to the package directions. So, you
might need to adjust the boiling time if you choose a thinner or smaller
pasta, but any type will work.

## Can I Add Vegetables?

Yes! I almost always add extra vegetables to whatever I’m cooking, but
today I decided to go with the classic form of Baked Ziti. If I were to
add vegetables, I would probably add some fresh spinach into the sauce
and stir until it is wilted. Or, roast some broccoli, zucchini, or
eggplant, and then toss that into the sauce.

## Recipe Tips!

I’ve made this recipe SO many times since I first shared it, and I’ve
picked up a few tips along the way (with some of them coming from
readers like you!):

-   **Shop sales + coupons:** I always stock up on canned tomatoes when
    they go on sale. And if you have a coupon? That would make this
    already budget-friendly recipe even cheaper!
-   **Make it ahead:** This recipe is great for prepping up to 24 hours
    ahead of time. Assemble as directed, let the pasta and sauce cool,
    then cover tightly with foil and refrigerate. You’ll just need to
    increase the baking time (while covered with foil) as needed since
    you’re baking the dish from chilled.
-   **Bulk ingredients are cheaper:** Check the price per unit to see if
    it’s worth buying in bulk. If I know that I’ll use a lot of
    something (like dried herbs), then it makes sense to buy in bulk.
-   **Double the sauce:** The amount of sauce in this recipe was more
    than enough for me, but some readers doubled the sauce for a saucier
    pasta bake. If you like things extra saucy, then go ahead and double
    it. I’d still only use the 1lb of ground sausage, though, to keep it
    budget-friendly.
-   **Use ground sausage:** I use ground Italian sausage because it’s
    already seasoned and adds great flavor to the dish. You can also use
    regular Italian sausage in a pinch; just slice open the casings and
    squeeze the sausage out! Just use whatever you already have or can
    get the best deal on. :)

## What to Serve with Baked Ziti?

[Homemade Garlic Bread](https://www.budgetbytes.com/garlic-bread/) is
awesome with this recipe, but if you want some vegetables on the side I
would go with something like [Oven Roasted Frozen
Broccoli](https://www.budgetbytes.com/oven-roasted-frozen-broccoli/), or
a [simple side
salad](https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-make-a-simple-side-salad/).

## How to Store the Leftovers

Leftovers will keep in the refrigerator for 4-5 days. I highly suggest
dividing the leftovers into single servings so they cool quickly in the
refrigerator. This recipe makes 8 large servings, so once the servings
are cooled completely in the refrigerator, you can transfer a few to the
freezer for longer storage. Then each serving is just a quick microwave
away from being a filling last-minute dinner!

### Ingredients

▢ 1 lb. ground Italian sausage (sweet, mild, or hot) ($4.99)

▢ 1 yellow onion ($0.27)

▢ 3 oz. tomato paste ($0.50)

▢ 1 28oz. can crushed tomatoes ($1.89)

▢ 1 Tbsp Italian seasoning blend ($0.30)

▢ 1/2 cup water ($0.00)

▢ 1 lb. ziti ($1.67)

▢ 1/2 Tbsp salt (for pasta water) ($0.05)

▢ 15 oz. ricotta ($3.39)

▢ 1 cup Italian cheese blend\* ($1.24)

▢ 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper ($0.05)

▢ 2 cups shredded mozzarella ($2.29)

▢ 1 handful chopped parsley (optional, for garnish) ($0.20)

### Instructions 

-   Brown the sausage in a large skillet or pot over medium heat, until
    it's brown and crispy on the edges (pork sausage contains a lot of
    fat, so I didn't add any extra to the skillet).

-   While the sausage is browning, finely dice the onion. Add the onion
    to the skillet once the sausage has browned, and continue to sauté
    over medium heat until the onion is soft and translucent.

-   Add the tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, Italian seasoning, and ½ cup
    water to the skillet with the sausage and stir to combine. Place a
    lid on the skillet and allow it to come up to a simmer. Once
    simmering, turn the heat down and allow it to continue to simmer
    while you cook the ziti. Stir the sauce occasionally as it simmers.

-   After getting the sauce started, begin the ziti. Bring a large pot
    of water with ½ Tbsp salt to a boil over high heat. Once boiling,
    add the ziti, and let it continue to boil until tender (about 7-8
    minutes). Drain the pasta in a colander. Shake the colander a bit to
    shake excess water out of the pasta.

-   While the pasta and sauce are cooking, prepare the cheese filling.
    Add the ricotta, Italian cheese blend, and some freshly cracked
    black pepper (about 10 cranks of a pepper mill) to a bowl and stir
    to combine. **Begin to preheat the oven to 350ºF.**

-   After draining the ziti, return it to the pot and add 1 cup of the
    red sauce. Stir to coat the cooked pasta in sauce.

-   Pour half of the ziti to a 9×13" baking dish. Add half of the
    ricotta mixture on top of the pasta in small dollops. Finally, spoon
    half of the red sauce and sausage over the pasta and ricotta. It's
    okay if the ingredients don't cover in a solid layer. Repeat these
    layers with the second half of the pasta, ricotta mixture, and
    sauce. Finally, top with 2 cups shredded mozzarella.

-   Cover the baking dish with foil, making sure it's slightly tented so
    that it doesn't touch or stick to the melted cheese. Transfer the
    covered casserole to the oven and bake for 20 minutes.

-   After baking for 20 minutes, remove the foil, and turn the oven on
    to broil (keep the casserole on the middle rack, about 10-12 inches
    from the broiler). Broil for 5 minutes, or just until the cheese is
    slightly browned. Keep a close eye on the baked ziti as it broils,
    because broilers can vary in intensity. Top with chopped parsley, if
    desired, then serve.

## How to Make Baked Ziti – Step by Step Photos

![Browned Italian sausage in a

Begin by browning 1 pound Italian sausage in a skillet until it is brown
and crispy on the edges. Pork sausage has quite a bit of fat in it on
its own, so I didn’t add any extra to the skillet.

![Diced onion added to the skillet with the
sausage](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E)[](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?media=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.budgetbytes.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F10%2FAdd-Diced-Onion-to-Sausage.jpg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.budgetbytes.com%2Fclassic-baked-ziti%2F%3Futm_source%3Dpinterest%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dgrow-social-pro&is_video=false&description=This%20Easy%20Baked%20Ziti%20recipe%20has%20layers%20of%20pasta%2C%20homemade%20red%20sauce%20with%20Italian%20sausage%2C%20and%20three%20types%20of%20melty%20cheese!rn)

While the sausage is browning, finely dice a yellow onion. Add it to the
skillet with the browned sausage and continue to sauté for a few minutes
more, or until the onion is soft and translucent.

![Crushed tomatoes being poured into the skillet, with sausage, onions,

Add 3 oz. tomato paste (half of a 6 oz. can – don’t forget to [freeze
the rest of the
can](https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-freeze-tomato-paste/)!), 1 Tbsp
Italian seasoning blend, one 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes, and 1/2 cup
water. Stir to combine, place a lid on the skillet, and let it come up
to a simmer. Once simmering, turn the heat down to low and let it
continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, while you begin cooking the
ziti.

![Boiled ziti in a pot of water with a wooden
spoon](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E)[](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?media=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.budgetbytes.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F10%2FBoiled-Ziti.jpg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.budgetbytes.com%2Fclassic-baked-ziti%2F%3Futm_source%3Dpinterest%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dgrow-social-pro&is_video=false&description=This%20Easy%20Baked%20Ziti%20recipe%20has%20layers%20of%20pasta%2C%20homemade%20red%20sauce%20with%20Italian%20sausage%2C%20and%20three%20types%20of%20melty%20cheese!rn)

Once the sauce is simmering away, begin cooking the ziti. Bring a large
pot of water with 1/2 Tbsp salt to a boil over high heat. Once boiling,
add 1 lb. ziti. Continue to boil the pasta until tender, then drain in a
colander. Shake the colander a bit to shake out the excess water.

While the ziti is boiling and the sauce is simmering, make the ricotta
cheese blend. Add 15 oz. ricotta, 1 cup Italian cheese blend, and some
freshly cracked black pepper to a bowl. Stir to combine. Also begin to
preheat the oven to 350ºF at the time.

After draining the ziti, return it to the pot and add 1 cup of the red
sauce. Stir to coat the pasta in the sauce.

Pour half of the sauce coated ziti into a 9×13″ casserole dish. Add half
of the ricotta mixture on top of the pasta in small dollops, then add
half of the red sauce on top. Don’t worry if the layers don’t cover each
other in a solid layer. It doesn’t have to be perfect!

Repeat with a second layer of pasta, ricotta mixture, and sauce, then
top with 2 cups shredded mozzarella.

Cover the casserole with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Make sure the
foil is slightly tented so it doesn’t touch the cheese and stick when it
melts.

After baking for 20 minutes, remove the foil, turn the oven to broil,
and return the casserole to the oven (keep it on the middle rack, about
10-12 inches from the broiler). Broil for about 5 minutes, or just until
the cheese is brown on top. Keep a close eye as it broils because
broilers can vary in intensity.
