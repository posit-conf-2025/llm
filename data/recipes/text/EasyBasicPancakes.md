This surprisingly quick and easy pancake recipe has been our most
popular for years—and with good reason. You’ll only need a handful of
basic fridge and pantry ingredients like all-purpose flour, sugar, eggs,
butter, and milk, and pulling together the simple batter takes just five
minutes. As the pancakes cook, transfer them to the oven to keep warm,
then stack them high and serve with plenty of softened butter and maple
syrup.

Start with our basic recipe, or try one of our variations using
buttermilk or yogurt. Either way, you’ll have fluffy, golden pancakes
ready to eat in less than half an hour.

##  How to Make Fluffy Homemade Pancakes Every Time 

-   **Use fresh ingredients.** Check your flour and [baking
    powder](https://www.marthastewart.com/8116143/how-test-baking-powder-still-good)
    to make sure they haven't expired or gone rancid.
-   **Don't over-mix.** When combining your wet and dry ingredients,
    whisk only until you no longer see any dry spots of flour.
    Over-mixing will make pancakes tougher (since gluten develops in the
    flour) and less fluffy (which happens when leaveners release
    bubbles).
-   **Let batter rest.** Resting about 10 minutes allows the leaveners
    to continue to work their magic, creating and expanding into
    thousands of tiny pockets of carbon dioxide. The fluffier the
    batter, the fluffier the pancakes.
-   **Start with a hot surface.** Allow your skillet or
    [griddle](https://www.marthastewart.com/7987506/what-is-griddle-how-use)
    to fully heat up before you add batter.   
-   **Make a test pancake.** This is your practice run to gauge and
    adjust the temperature and cook time. Peek frequently at the
    underside to check if the pancake is browning at the right pace. 
-   **Don't press the pancakes.** It's tempting to press down on the
    pancakes with a spatula after flipping, but this will result in a
    dense, gummy pancake.

Cooking the pancakes in butter can cause the milk solids to burn,
leaving behind black specks and a noticeable flavor. For that reason, we
prefer to use oil for this and other pancake recipes.

##  How to Tell When Pancakes Are Ready to Flip 

For golden, fluffy pancakes that are neither gummy inside or overcooked,
wait to flip them until you see several bubbles on the surface—and a few
that have already burst—which should take about 2 minutes. The batter
should begin to look slightly dry, especially along the outer edge of
each pancake.

After flipping, let them cook for an additional minute or so, then peek
at the second side. When it looks equally golden, remove the pancakes
and transfer them to a warm oven until you're ready to serve. It'll take
less time to cook the second side than the first, so stay close by and
have that spatula and an oven-proof plate ready to go.

## Ingredients

-   1 cup all-purpose flour, (spooned and leveled)

-   2 tablespoons sugar

-   2 teaspoons baking powder

-   ½ teaspoon salt

-   1 cup milk

-   2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, or vegetable oil

-   1 large egg

-   1 tablespoon vegetable oil

-   Assorted toppings, such as butter, maple syrup, confectioners'
    sugar, honey, jams, preserves, sweetened whipped cream, or chocolate
    syrup

## Directions

Diana Chistruga

1.  ###  Preheat oven: 

    Preheat oven to 200°F. Have a baking sheet or heatproof platter
    ready to keep cooked pancakes warm in the oven.

2.  ###  Mix dry ingredients: 

    In a small bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and
    salt; set aside.

    Diana Chistruga

3.  ###  Mix wet ingredients: 

    In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, butter (or oil), and egg.

4.  ###  Combine wet and dry ingredients: 

    Add dry ingredients to milk mixture; whisk until just moistened. (Do
    not overmix; a few small lumps are fine.)

    Diana Chistruga

5.  ###  Heat and oil skillet or griddle: 

    Heat a large skillet (nonstick or cast-iron) or griddle over medium.
    Fold a sheet of paper towel in half, and moisten with oil; carefully
    rub skillet with oiled paper towel.

    Diana Chistruga

6.  ###  Spoon batter onto skillet or griddle: 

    For each pancake, spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter onto skillet,
    using the back of the spoon to spread batter into a round (you
    should be able to fit 2 to 3 in a large skillet).

    Diana Chistruga

7.  ###  Cook first side: 

    Cook until surface of pancakes have some bubbles and a few have
    burst, 1 to 2 minutes.

    Credit:
    Diana Chistruga

8.  ###  Flip pancakes: 

    Flip carefully with a thin spatula, and cook until browned on the
    underside, 1 to 2 minutes more.

    Credit:
    Diana Chistruga

    Choose a thin, broad spatula (the same width as the pancakes, if
    possible) and turn each one over as gently and quickly as possible.
    The second side should take less time than the first, so keep an eye
    on them.

9.  ###  Serve immediately, or keep warm in oven: 

    Transfer to a baking sheet or platter; cover loosely with aluminum
    foil, and keep warm in oven while you cook. Continue with more oil
    and remaining batter. (You'll have 12 to 15 pancakes.) Serve warm,
    with desired toppings.

##  Storing and Reheating Pancakes and Batter 

-   **To store pancake batter:** If you have leftover pancake batter
    that you will use within one day, keep the batter in the mixing bowl
    or measuring cup you mixed it in, cover it with plastic wrap, and
    store it in the refrigerator. If you won't be using the batter
    within a day, cook the rest of the pancakes and store them to reheat
    another time.
-   **To store leftover pancakes:** Leftover pancakes freeze well. Be
    sure to let them cool completely before refrigerating or freezing.
    We recommend storing leftover pancakes in the refrigerator if you
    will eat them within a few days. For longer storage, freeze them.
    Whether you are refrigerating or freezing, keep them in a zip-top
    [freezer
    bag](https://www.marthastewart.com/can-you-reuse-plastic-freezer-sandwich-bags-11719949),
    separating them with wax or parchment paper so they don't stick.
    Make sure all the air is removed from the freezer bag.

###  How to Reheat Leftover Pancakes 

There are several ways to reheat leftover pancakes, but we recommend
using the oven method if you have a number of pancakes to reheat. If
you're reheating just a few, use your toaster. Avoid the microwave;
pancakes tend to cool and dry out more quickly with this method.

-   **Reheating in the oven:** Preheat the oven to 350 degrees
    Fahrenheit. Place pancakes on a rimmed sheet pan and warm through.
    This will take between 6 and 10 minutes if you are starting with
    frozen pancakes; leftover pancakes from the refrigerator need less
    time.
-   **Reheating in the toaster:** Place one pancake in each slot of the
    toaster and set it to a medium toast level. If the pancakes aren't
    warmed sufficiently, toast them again at a lower setting.

##  Pancake Variations 

###  Buttermilk 

In step 1, add 1/2 teaspoon baking soda to dry mixture. In step 2,
replace the milk with low-fat buttermilk.

###  Yogurt 

In step 1, add 1/2 teaspoon baking soda to dry mixture. In step 2,
replace the milk with 2/3 cup plain low-fat yogurt and 1/3 cup milk.

###  Wholegrain With Yogurt 

In step 1, replace the all-purpose flour with 1/2 cup whole-wheat flour,
1/4 cup each cornmeal and wheat germ, and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda. In
step 2, replace the milk with 2/3 cup plain low-fat yogurt and 1/3 cup
milk.

##  What to Serve With These Easy Pancakes 

Butter, maple syrup, confectioners' sugar, honey, jams, preserves,
sweetened [whipped
cream](https://www.marthastewart.com/1529979/whipped-cream-tips),
chocolate syrup, and fresh fruit are all delicious toppings for homemade
pancakes.

To round out the meal, add a side of homemade [breakfast sausage
patties](https://www.marthastewart.com/341904/simple-homemade-sausage-patties)
or use your oven for the [crispiest-ever
bacon](https://www.marthastewart.com/264476/less-mess-bacon). You can
also add a few fried eggs ([this
technique](https://www.marthastewart.com/349208/perfect-fried-egg-every-time)
will give you perfect results every time), a heavenly
[scramble](https://www.marthastewart.com/8337648/how-to-make-perfect-scrambled-eggs-the-right-way),
and/or some zesty [sweet-potato home
fries](https://www.marthastewart.com/1524061/sweet-potato-home-fries).

## Frequently Asked Questions

-   Can you make pancakes ahead of time?

    Yes, you can make pancakes ahead of time. We don't recommend making
    them ahead of a more formal weekend brunch, since they taste best
    when hot off the griddle. Prepping a batch for quick weekday
    breakfasts, however, is a good idea; reheat as many as you need each
    morning.

      

-   Can I omit the sugar?

    No, we don't recommend omitting the sugar. Most pancake recipes use
    only a small amount of sugar (our recipe has 2 tablespoons of sugar
    for four servings). Even this small amount plays an important role
    in the batter. You can omit sweeteners, but your pancakes will be
    rubbery in texture. 

      

-   Can I use water or dairy-free milk instead?

    Yes, you can use water or dairy-free milk instead. Choose an
    unsweetened option; replace the exact amount of dairy milk called
    for with your favorite alternative milk. You can use water, but the
    resulting pancakes will be less rich and flavorful.

      

-   Can I use another flour besides all purpose?

    Yes, you can use another flour besides all purpose for this
    recipe—with some caveats. For a gluten-free version, use a 1-to-1
    gluten-free flour mix but we do not recommend swapping in a
    gluten-free flour like almond or oat flour. Substituting whole-wheat
    flour for all-purpose flour in our Easy Basic Pancakes recipe will
    result in a thinner batter; pancakes will also spread more in the
    pan. We recommend swapping only half the all-purpose for whole wheat
    flour for a healthier but still tender and tasty pancake.

A keeper!Easy to followFamily favoriteGreat flavors

I’ve been making these pancakes for over 5 years. They are super easy
tomake and give light, low sugar pancakes with the perfect thickness for
us. My daughter loves them! If you are looking for super thick, sugary
pancakes these are not it. I do change things up a bit and use whole
wheat flour and olive oil. My pancakes are about 1/2 inch thick. I also
add a splash of vanilla. These are fun because you can sprinkle cinnamon
on top while they are cooking, oatmeal, or throw in some berries if you
want additional flavor.

Whatever assistant slapped together this recipe botched it hard core.
First of all, the appropriate ratio is ONE tsp baking powder to ONE cup
flour. Baking powder has a distinct metallic taste, adding the amount in
the recipe wouldn't improve the lift but it would make it taste like a
tin can. GROSS.Second of all, if you use buttermilk and baking soda, you
should OMIT the baking powder. Because um... baking basics 101. Or, you
could leave the baking soda out, use the 1 tsp baking powder and
buttermilk. Either way it'll work fine for pancakes.

A keeper!Easy to follow

DIdn't have to buy one new thing to make this! A 'pantry' recipe indeed!
Bonus for me: as I live alone I halved it, and ate half of that (so a
quarter, I guess). I then just refrigerated the remaining batter in a
small Tupperware-esque container, and didn't cook it until 2 days later.
Glad to say the batter held up very well, and the pancake was even
tastier!
