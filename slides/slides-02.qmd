# How to think about LLMs {.dark-blue background-image="assets/retro-mac.jpg" background-size="cover" background-position="bottom left"}

```

::: notes
Some motivational words by Joe urging everyone to approach LLMs with curiosity and experimentation rather than preconceived notions about limitations, while building understanding from the ground up through practical experience.
:::

## Think Empirically, Not Theoretically {.center .text-center}

## Think Empirically, Not Theoretically {.center .text-center}

- It's okay to treat LLMs as **black boxes**. \
  We're not going to focus on how they work internally

- **Just try it!** When wondering if an LLM can do something,\
  experiment rather than theorize

- You might think they could not possibly do things\
  _that they clearly can do today_

::: notes
- Understanding the technical details can lead to **bad intuition** about capabilities
- You might think "they could not possibly do things that they clearly can do today"
- Empirical testing reveals actual capabilities vs. theoretical limitations
:::

## Embrace the Experimental Process {.center .text-center}

## Embrace the Experimental Process {.center .text-center}

- **Don't worry about ROI** during exploration. \
  Focus on learning and engaging with the technology

- **Failure is valuable!** \
  _those are some of the most interesting conversations that we have_

- **It doesn't have to be a success.** \
  Attempts that don't work still provide insights

::: notes
- Use the **best models available** for experimentation
- Don't constrain yourself to "practical" applications initially
- Think of it as forming your own independent conclusions about usefulness
:::

## Start Simple, Build Understanding {.center .text-center}

## Start Simple, Build Understanding {.center .text-center}

- We're going to focus on the **core building blocks**.

- All the incredible things you see AI do \
  **decompose to just a few key ingredients**.

- Our goal is to **have fun and build intuition** \
  through hands-on experience.

::: notes
- Think **very generally** about what tools can do - they're as powerful as any software you can write
- Remember: **"Everything decomposes"** to the basic components once you understand the underlying APIs
- Build intuition through hands-on experience rather than theoretical study
- We want to have fun in this course! It's worth saying up front that our examples are not necessarily practical, but they're full of practical lessons.

::: notes
Those conversations often look something like this:

You ask a question and ChatGPT responds.
You can keep talking to ChatGPT and it keeps responding,
almost like you're having a conversation with a person.

The entire conversation happens via HTTP requests and responses
:::

## What's an HTTP request?

::: notes
HTTP requests power the internet.
When you visit a website, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server hosting that website.
The server responds to the request by sending back the HTML of the webpage.
And then your browser makes a bunch more requests to get the images, stylesheets, and scripts that make up the page, etc.
:::

```{r}
#| output: asis

incremental_slides(
  pattern = "intro-conversation-google-.+[.]svg$",
  template = r"(::: {{.mt6}}
{{{{< include {path} >}}}}
:::)",
  collapse = "\n\n## What's an HTTP request?\n\n"
)
```

## Talking with ChatGPT happens via HTTP

::: notes
Talking to an LLM like ChatGPT also happens via HTTP requests.
When you send a message to ChatGPT, you're sending an HTTP request to OpenAI's servers, this time a `POST` request.

OpenAI processes the request, runs the model, gets the answer and sends it back to you as the response to that POST request.
:::

```{r}
#| output: asis

incremental_slides(
  pattern = "intro-conversation-chat-.+[.]svg$",
  template = r"(::: {{.mt6}}
{{{{< include {path} >}}}}
:::
  )",
  collapse = "\n\n## Talking with ChatGPT happens via HTTP\n\n"
)
```

## Messages have roles

```{r}
#| output: asis

incremental_slides(
  pattern = "intro-conversation-roles-.+[.]svg$",
  template = r"(::: {{.tc}}
{{{{< include {path} >}}}}
:::)",
  collapse = "\n\n## Messages have roles\n\n"
)
```

## Message roles

| Role        | Description                                                       |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `system_prompt` | Instructions from the developer (that's you!)<br>to set the behavior of the assistant |
| `user`       | Messages from the person interacting<br>with the assistant        |
| `assistant`  | The AI model's responses to the user                           |

# Your Turn `02_word-game` {.slide-your-turn}

::: {style="--li-margin: 0.66em;"}
1. Set up a `chat` with a system prompt:

   > You are playing a word guessing game. At each turn, guess the word and tell us what it is.

2. **Ask:** _In British English, guess the word for the person who lives next door._

3. **Ask:** _What helps a car move smoothly down the road?_

4. Create a new, empty `chat` and ask the second question again.

5. How do the answers to 3 and 4 differ? Why?

GPT is a type of LLM, but not all LLMs are GPTs.

LLM: Deep learning on huge amounts of text data to understand and generate human language.
GPT: Specific architectural design of LLMs.

From now on, we'll use **LLM** to refer to any large language model.

::: notes
The breakthrough insight is the attention mechanism in the Transformer architecture.
Instead of processing text sequentially (word by word),
GPT models can look at all words in a sequence simultaneously
and understand how they relate to each other.

The attention mechanism allows the model to:

* Weigh the importance of every word in relation to every other word
* Capture long-range dependencies that traditional models missed
* Process sequences in parallel rather than sequentially
:::

## Actually: tokens, not words {.center}

::: {.incremental}
- Fundamental units of information for LLMs
- Words, parts of words, or individual characters
  - "hello" → 1 token
  - "unconventional" → 3 tokens: `un|con|ventional`
- Important for:
  - Model input/output limits
  - [API pricing](https://llmpricecheck.com/calculator/) is usually by token
- Not just words, but images can be tokenized too

:::

::: notes
The newest and biggest models from OpenAI and Google
can handle 1 million input tokens at once.

Which is kind of like saying that you could paste

* 30 hours of podcasts
* 1,000 pages of a book
* 60,000 lines of code

into the chat window and the model could "pay attention" to it all.

1M is the upper limit currently, most models accept up to around 200k tokens.
